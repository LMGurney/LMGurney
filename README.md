<h2>Research and Scholarship Interests</h2>

<p>My research focuses on improving student self-efficacy in computer usage and application within career fields. Engaging cross-discipline students to apply classroom theory in the creation of computing solution and the impact on improved computing and technology self-confidence.  Additional research topics include the impact of Information Diagnosticity of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on purchase intentions and the influences of online social sentiment on consumer intentions.</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúI have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.‚Äù ‚ÄìLeonardo da Vinci.</blockquote>
<br>

<p>As teaching faculty, I‚Äôve found this to be true. Doing is one of the most important aspects of learning. I encourage my students to DO both in and out of class. By applying skills and knowledge they learn more than textbook materials, they explore their own abilities to accomplish goals and build life-long confidence to DO. As a teacher I mentor the 'DOING'.</p>
